Since you're using the **free version of VS Code** (not managed through Visual Studio Code for Education or Business), there's no built-in enterprise management layer â€” but you can still **lock down extensions** through a combination of **OS-level controls**, **VS Code settings**, and possibly **third-party tools like Intune or Cisco EDR**.

Here are 3 main methods you can use:

---

### âœ… **Option 1: Disable Extension Installation via `settings.json` (User or Workspace Level)**

1. **Create a Workspace or User settings file** with the following:

   ```json
   {
     "extensions.ignoreRecommendations": true,
     "extensions.autoUpdate": false,
     "extensions.autoCheckUpdates": false,
     "security.workspace.trust.enabled": false
   }
   ```
2. **Prevent installing new extensions** by using file system permissions:

   * Block write access to the extensions folder:

     * **Windows**: `%USERPROFILE%\.vscode\extensions`
     * **macOS/Linux**: `~/.vscode/extensions`
   * Set folder permissions so users **cannot modify** it.

> ðŸ”’ This works best when paired with endpoint management (like Intune or Cisco AMP) to enforce settings and permissions.

### âœ… **Option 2: Use Group Policy or Intune (Windows Environments)**

If you're managing devices via **Intune or GPO**, you can:

1. **Deploy VS Code with pre-approved extensions installed.**

2. Use a script or policy to:

   * Set file/folder permissions to prevent access to the `.vscode/extensions` directory.
   * Block internet access to the VS Code marketplace if needed: `https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/_apis/public/gallery`

3. You can also monitor or block unknown executables via **Cisco EDR** or AppLocker.

---

### âœ… **Option 3: Network-Level Blocking or EDR Policy (Cisco AMP or Secure Endpoint)**

* Use **Cisco Secure Endpoint (AMP)** or your firewall to block:

  * Domain: `marketplace.visualstudio.com`
  * VS Code Extension downloads: `*.vscode.azureedge.net`
* Set up application control policies to **monitor and restrict execution** of any new VSIX installations.

---

### Optional: Create an Approved Extension List (Whitelist)

Maintain a list of approved extensions, and script-install them during setup using:

```bash
code --install-extension <extension-id>
```

Then use the lock-down steps above to prevent any changes afterward.

Let me know your environment (Windows/macOS, use of Intune, etc.) and I can tailor the steps with deployment scripts or policies.
