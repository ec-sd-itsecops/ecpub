Here‚Äôs a **step-by-step plan** for  IT Security team member conducting onsite forensic triage and EDR installation on **12 compromised Windows 10 desktops**. the focus should be **quick evidence collection, threat containment, and EDR installation** to monitor any post-infection behavior until the reimage is complete.

---

## Onsite Forensic & Containment Plan (Windows 10)

###  1. **Preparation (Before Visit)**
- Bring:
  - Eternal USB drives (or SSDs) for log collection
  - Bootable Windows USB 
  - Cisco AMP installer for Windows (downloaded from console)
  - Ensure local admin credentials are available
  - Confirm no machines are powered off or tampered with before arrival

---

### 2. **Initial Triage (On Each Machine)**
1. **Do not power off or reboot the system.**
2. Disconnect from the internet **if not needed for forensic collection.**
3. Confirm local time settings (important for log correlation).
4. **Collect logs and system snapshots:**
### Step-by-Step: Export Event Logs with `wevtutil`

#### üñ•Ô∏è 1. **Open Command Prompt as Administrator**
- Click Start ‚Üí type `cmd`
- Right-click **Command Prompt** ‚Üí **Run as administrator**

#### üìÅ 2. **Create a Folder to Store Logs**
```cmd
mkdir C:\Logs
```

#### üì§ 3. **Run These Commands to Export Logs**
```cmd
wevtutil epl System C:\Logs\System.evtx
wevtutil epl Security C:\Logs\Security.evtx
wevtutil epl Application C:\Logs\Application.evtx
```

- `epl` = Export Log
- The `.evtx` files are the native format for Windows Event Viewer and can be analyzed later on another machine.
   - **Windows Event Logs**:
     ```bash
     wevtutil epl System C:\Logs\System.evtx
     wevtutil epl Security C:\Logs\Security.evtx
     wevtutil epl Application C:\Logs\Application.evtx
     ```
   - Export key artifacts:
     - `Prefetch`
     - `$MFT`, `$LogFile`, `$UsnJrnl`
     - Registry hives: `SAM`, `SYSTEM`, `SECURITY`, `SOFTWARE`
     - Browser history (optional)
     - Run `autoruns` from Sysinternals to snapshot persistence mechanisms
   - Capture process list, network connections:
     ```bash
     tasklist /v > C:\Logs\tasks.txt
     netstat -ano > C:\Logs\netstat.txt
     ```
   - Dump current memory (optional, if using tools like DumpIt or Magnet RAM Capture)

> üìÅ Store all logs securely in a `C:\Logs` folder and transfer to USB for central analysis

---

###  3. **Containment**
- If live network activity is suspicious, block outbound connections via Windows Firewall
- Stop unknown scheduled tasks or startup entries temporarily
- Revoke compromised user credentials

---

### 4. **Install Cisco AMP for Endpoints (EDR)**
1. Run the installer with local admin:
   ```bash
   amp_win_x64_installer.exe
   ```
2. Confirm device registration in the Cisco AMP console
3. Let the AMP agent run to observe any suspicious behavior pre-reimage

---

### 5. **Transfer Logs for Central Review**
- Encrypt USB drives if needed
- Create SHA256 hashes of files if chain-of-custody is needed
- Upload to secure internal share/SIEM/IR analyst workstation

---

###  6. **Post-Triage: Reimage**
- Use your standard corporate Windows 10 image
- Rejoin to domain
- Harden endpoints (apply CIS baseline if applicable)
- Reinstall Cisco AMP and verify connectivity
- Restore only clean, scanned data from backups if needed
